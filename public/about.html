<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Becky. I am a dedicated and passionate entrepreneur. I enjoy learning, reading, traveling, and building websites.</p>
<p>I have a Bachelors degree in Psychology and a Masters degree in Business Administration. My work history consists primarily of customer oriented positions such as Customer Service Representative, Waitress, Bartender, and Delivery Driver.</p>
<p>I have a great deal of background in volunteer work involving animal rescue, particularly cats. I work in my community to help reduce the stray cat overpopulation crisis by implementing research-based TNR practices (Trap, Neuter, Return). I also spend time volunteering with local animals rescues in my area and building relationships with community members.</p>
